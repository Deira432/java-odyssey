## Overview
Welcome to **Java Odyssey**! This repository is a record of my journey to learn Java, covering key concepts, coding challenges, projects, and more. This journey will take me from the fundamentals to more advanced topics, building up my skills one step at a time.

## Learning Goals
- Gain a strong foundation in Java syntax and programming principles
- Understand Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and its application in Java
- Build small to mid-size Java projects to reinforce learning
- Tackle algorithms and data structures to improve problem-solving skills

## Roadmap
### Week 1: Foundations
- Basic syntax and structure
- Data types, variables, and operators
- Control flow (loops and conditionals)

### Week 2: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Classes and objects
- Inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction
- Introduction to collections (ArrayList, HashMap)

### Week 3: Advanced Topics and Projects
- Exception handling and debugging
- File I/O
- Mini-projects for practice

... *(more to be added as the journey continues)*

## Topics Covered
1. **Java Basics** â€“ Syntax, variables, data types, and operators
2. **Control Flow** â€“ Loops, conditionals, and switch statements
3. **Object-Oriented Programming** â€“ Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.
4. **Collections and Data Structures** â€“ Lists, maps, and basic data structure algorithms
5. **Exception Handling** â€“ Try-catch blocks and custom exceptions
6. **File I/O** â€“ Reading and writing files in Java

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse (or just a text editor and command line)
